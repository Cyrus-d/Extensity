## Extensity

### Quickly enable/disable Google Chrome extensions

Tired of having too many extensions in your toolbar? Try Extensity, the ultimate tool

Just enable the extension when you want to use it, and disable when you want to
get rid of it for a little while. You can also launch Chrome Apps right from the list.

* Keep your browser fast - disable extensions that you won't use right away.
* Keep your toolbar clean
* Ideal companion for extensions collectors.
